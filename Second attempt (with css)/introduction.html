		<h2>What are platypus?</h2>
		<p>Platypus, sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. It is one of the five extant species of monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.</p>
		<p>Platypus is best described as a hodgepodge of more familiar species: the duck (bill and webbed feet), beaver (tail) and otter (body and fur).</p>

		<h2>Platypus in the water</h2>
		<p>They hunt underwater and swim gracefully by paddling with their front webbed feet and steering with their hind feet and beaver like tail. Folds of skin cover their eyes and ears to prevent water from entering, and the nostrils close with a watertight seal, which allows them to remain submerged for a minute or two. Below is a video of a platypus swimming in a public aquarium in Australia.</p>

		<h2>Platypus on land</h2>
		<p>On land, they move a bit more awkwardly. However, the webbing on their feet retracts to expose individual nails and allow the creatures to run. They use their nails and feet to construct dirt burrows at the water's edge. Below is a video of a platypus crawling on land.</p>
